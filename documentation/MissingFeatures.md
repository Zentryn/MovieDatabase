## Missing features and more

The application is working base for an application that could be expanded greatly. There are several new features that could be added:
* Movie trailer links or embedded trailer playback
* Links to streaming services that offer a movie
* Additional movie art
* Movie production crew information with images
* "New releases" section
* Improved search functionality
* User profiles that would show a user's library among other things
* Support for TV Shows
* ...and more

The application is semi-expandable in its current form. However some minor code restructuring and some general changes to how the application works could make it more expandable. These could include:
* A better templating system (maybe)
* Better naming for some methods / variables
* Separating the code into more smaller parts
* Creating class functions for all types of modifying of a class
